\def\Log{\mathop{\textbf{Log}}}

\begin{document}
  We prove that the sum $\sum_{\left\{{d\le x,\\
        (d,r)=1}\right.}\mu(d)/d^{1+\varepsilon}$ is bounded by $1+\varepsilon$, uniformly in
  $x\ge1$, $r$ and $\varepsilon>0$. We prove a similar estimate for the quantity
  $\sum_{\left\{{d\le x,\\
        (d,r)=1}\right.}\mu(d)\Log(x/d)/d^{1+\varepsilon}$. When $\varepsilon=0$, $r$ varies
  between 1 and a hundred, and $x$ is
  below a million, this sum is non-negative and this raises the question as to
  whether it is non-negative \emph{for every~$x$}.
