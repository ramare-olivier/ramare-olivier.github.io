  We prove non-trivial lower bounds for sums of
  type $\sum_{p\sim P}g(\gamma\log p)$, where $g$ is a non-negative $2\pi$-periodical
  function and $\gamma$ is a given parameter. As an application we prove that
  $\zeta(1+it)^{\pm1}\ll\log\log (9+|t|)$ and extend the zero-free region of
  the Riemann zeta-function.
