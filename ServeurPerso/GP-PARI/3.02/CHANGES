=================
FROM 2.55 to 2.99
=================
This version and later ones require the emacs version being at least 20.3.
If you are used to versions of pari.el below 2.55, we recommend you read
the README file since a good number of changes have occured in between. Rapidly
speaking, fontification is now handled by font-lock and not by hilit19, and
customization is systematically handle by 'custom.el, so that a good number
of switches have disappeared from the menu-bar. Indentation has appeared
with the neat effect that C-i/TAB is *not* completion anymore. Completion
is got by M-i. Variables are now in "positive form", so that for instance
gp-no-fontify has been replaced by gp-fontifyp and so on. Also, the
distribution consists of 9 files:
   pari.el                : the main engine
   pari-messages.el       : messages
   pari-fontification.el  : support for font-lock
   pari-help.el           : info and help, browser
   pari-completion.el     : completion
   sli-tools.el           : indentation, version 0.97 or higher
   pari-conf.el.in        : system dependent variables
   Makefile               : makefile to create pari-conf.el and to install
                            the distribution
   pariemacs-3.02.txt     : this file
=================
FROM 3.00 to 3.02
=================
From version 3.00 onwards, further simplifications have occurred:
completion files have been completely removed, since the dabbrev mode
(dynamical abbreviation mode) of emacs is largely enough (M-/ will
complete word according to words found around, or in nearby buffers).

Also, the distribution consists now of 12 files:
   pari.el                : the main engine
   pari-messages.el       : messages
   pari-fontification.el  : support for font-lock
   pari-help.el           : info and help, browser
   pari-completion.el     : completion
   pari-history.el        : history for shell commands
   sli-tools.el           : indentation, version 0.97 or higher
   pari-conf.el.in        : system dependent variables
   Makefile               : makefile to create pari-conf.el and to install
                            the distribution
   CHANGES                : this file
   README                 : notes on how to install and use pariemacs;
                            essentially what was called pariemacs-<version>.txt.
