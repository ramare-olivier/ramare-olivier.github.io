This package was developped alongside PARI/GP for a long time.
The original pari.el was written by Annette Hoffman.

=================
FROM 2.55 to 2.99
=================
This version and later ones require the emacs version being at least 20.3.
If you are used to versions of pari.el below 2.55, we recommend you read
the README file since a good number of changes have occured in between. Rapidly
speaking, fontification is now handled by font-lock and not by hilit19, and
customization is systematically handle by 'custom.el, so that a good number
of switches have disappeared from the menu-bar. Indentation has appeared
with the neat effect that C-i/TAB is *not* completion anymore. Completion
is got by M-i. Variables are now in "positive form", so that for instance
gp-no-fontify has been replaced by gp-fontifyp and so on. Also, the
distribution consists of 9 files:
   pari.el                : the main engine
   pari-messages.el       : messages
   pari-fontification.el  : support for font-lock
   pari-help.el           : info and help, browser
   pari-completion.el     : completion
   sli-tools.el           : indentation, version 0.97 or higher
   pari-conf.el.in        : system dependent variables
   Makefile               : makefile to create pari-conf.el and to install
                            the distribution
   pariemacs-<version>.txt: this file
=================
FROM 3.00 to 3.02
=================
From version 3.00 onwards, further simplifications have occurred:
completion files have been completely removed, since the dabbrev mode
(dynamical abbreviation mode) of emacs is largely enough (M-/ will
complete word according to words found around, or in nearby buffers).

Also, the distribution consists now of 12 files:
   pari.el                : the main engine
   pari-messages.el       : messages
   pari-fontification.el  : support for font-lock
   pari-help.el           : info and help, browser
   pari-completion.el     : completion
   pari-history.el        : history for shell commands
   sli-tools.el           : indentation, version 0.97 or higher
   pari-conf.el.in        : system dependent variables
   Makefile               : makefile to create pari-conf.el and to install
                            the distribution
   CHANGES                : this file
   README                 : notes on how to install and use pariemacs;
                            essentially what was called pariemacs-<version>.txt.

=================
FROM 3.02 to 3.03
=================
-- Modification of the prompt pattern to take care of break>.
-- Initial message explaining somewhat the levels of loading.
-- Enhanced the messages concerning lisp functions by adding more
   cross-references.
-- Removed call to obsolete font-lock-unset-default in
   gp-make-gp-prompt-pattern.
-- Added a menu-item to get the prompt to display time in format (HH:MM:SS).
-- Face gp-error used in override mode.
-- font-lock-keywords-only set to t in gp-mode.
-- Removed gp-search-forward-string-delimiter in pari-fontification.el.
-- The character " in plots does not trigger string coloring in next
   input.
-- Parisize increased to 10000 in process Simple PARI (for the browser).
-- A menu-bar item has been added to toggle the timer.
-- The word "time = " for the timer gets a special colour.
-- The prompt is in bold face now.
-- Buffers linked with the browser are now invisible because
   their names gp-functions-list-buffer-name, 
               gp-function-description-buffer-name,
               gp-browser-buffer-name, gp-pari-simple-buffer-name
   now starts with a space.
-- Copyright extended to 2009 :)
-- Loading a file when last line is not empty does not lead to a mistake.
-- Prompt can be changed even if the last line contains something.
-- Global variables should be at beginning of line.
-- All words in ?11 except 
   read readvec install 
   are now colored in gp-control-statement.
-- Modified the regexp used in gp-find-global-var for speed
   (it could be so slow on long buffer that it stopped everything).
=================
FROM 3.03 to 3.04
=================
-- Changed read-input to read-string
-- Changed last-command-char to last-command-event
=================
FROM 3.04 to 3.05
=================
-- Introduced gp-flag-for-emacs in pari-conf.el
=================
FROM 3.05 to 3.06
=================
-- Corrected gp-flag-for-emacs in pari-conf.el
=================
FROM 3.06 to 3.07
=================
-- gp-ask-name-wisely corrected to accomodate emacs 24 
   (thanks to Kevin Ryde, Australia)
=================
FROM 3.07 to 3.08
=================
-- gp-script-mode makes 'block-comment-start and 'block-comment-end buffer local.
-- function-variable gp-indent-comment defined and set to 'indent-for-tab-command.
-- gp-call-gphelp has been modified. 
   Uses an explicit temporary buffer is OUTPUT-BUFFER is nil.
   Uses 'ansi-color-apply-on-region to remove special characters otherwise.
-- gp-get-apropos handles "\_" properly (i.e. corrects gphelp output)
   Buffer *gp-menu* is now marked unmodified.
-- gp-get-man-entry
   Buffer *gp-help* is now marked unmodified.
-- gp-meta-cmd-general is corrected: auxiliary prompt is not stiffened anymore.
   As a result Help on Subject "euler" (instead of "Euler") works:)
-- gp-make-browser uses gp-flag-for-emacs now.
-- gp-make-browser kills the process and sits awhile
   before killing the buffer to avoid questions. This does not mend fully
   the problem though.
-- gp-browser-buffer-name is now declared not modified at beginning.
-- Adding of gp-environment in gp-script-mode (modif de gp-init-menu-bar)
-- Modified some messages concerning the menu-bar and the order in the menu-bar.
-- Maid and Tutor are introduced in the menu-bar. 
   C-c C-c is switched to gp-maid and not to gp-run-gp as previously.
   This is consistant with the emacs-ism that says C-c C-c should be 
   "Do the next obvious thing". First try to close expressions, and second 
   evaluate the file. README file modified accordingly.
-- Kevin Ryde: setting default for gp-flag-for-emacs to "--emacs"
   (supported from version 2.3.0 onwards and not 2.6.1 as previously claimed).
-- Kevin Ryde: help string of gp-auto-indent modified.
=================
FROM 3.07 to 3.10
=================
-- Makefile modified, target pari.el-in was missing.
-- Introduction of pari.cfg-default, corresponding modification of README.
-- Modification of maketarfile.sh.
-- Kevin Ryde: comment-start-skip modified in gp-learn-sexp.
-- Kevin Ryde: gp-call-gphelp quotes its `word' parameter with
   shell-quote-argument, instead of just "" double quotes.
-- KR & OR: gp-send-region cleans last-line like gp-run-gp.
-- KR: gp-indent-level declared safe-local-variable.
-- KR: gp-make-prompt-pattern uses with-temp-buffer instead of messing with
   the *Messages* buffer.
-- KR: gp-locked-yank now propagates a C-u argument to the normal yank.
-- KR & OR: 'pari-mode-hook 'gp-script-mode-hook moved down in gp-script-mode,
   though they are not yet the last thing as should be.
   run-hooks changed to run-mode-hooks for 'gp-script-mode-hook in
   gp-script-mode. These changes have not been made in pari-mode.
-- KR: gp-get-shell uses process-environment and setenv for portability.
-- KR: gp-stiffen-prompt and gp-background modified to get a cleaner signal
   when gp refuses to start.
-- OR: adding of forvec, parfor, sum, parsum, apply, parapply, forsubgroup,
   forstep, fordiv, forell to gp-structures.
   Adding of parapply, parfor, parsum, sum, vector, parvector,
   to pari-fontification-keywords.
-- OR: gp-maid "works" when inside comments and has been generally reworked.
-- OR: off-topic: sli-get-safe-[back/for]ward-place has now 
   match-[beginning/end] and not -- the reverse!
-- OR: gp-locked-mouse-2 incorporates the possibility of a universal argument.
