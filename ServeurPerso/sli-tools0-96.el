;; sli-tools.el --- structured languages indentation package

;; It works out some tools for indentation of structured programs.
;; It has been written for mupad.el and pari.el but should apply to
;; any other structured language like Pascal.
;; See sli-tools and sli-structures below.

;; Maintainer: Olivier Ramare <ramare@NONONONOmath.univ-lille1.fr>

;; version 0.96

;; BUGS:
;; (1) If I remember well, strings spreading over several lines may
;;     raise some troubles.
;; (2) sli-tutor has some troubles if used in the middle of already
;;     complete structures.

(defvar sli-structures nil
  "List of lists. Each item is a vector or a list which we call a STRUCTURE
in this explanation. There are several kind of structures :

([HEAD-STRING head INDENT-HEAD]
 [SOFT-STRING1 soft INDENT-SOFT1]
 ([STRONG-STRING1 strong INDENT-STRONG1]
  [SOFT-STRING2 soft INDENT-SOFT2])
 ([STRONG-STRING2 strong INDENT-STRONG2])
 [END-STRING end])
is the usual structure, like in 'if/then/(elif/then)/(else)/end_if'.
Between the 'head' and the 'soft', INDENT-HEAD is used on subsequent lines
to offset the new line with respect to the beginning of HEAD-STRING. When
the 'soft' is found, INDENT-SOFT1 is used still with respect to the 'head'.
The next part is optional.
The STRONG-STRING is aligned on its 'head' and INDENT-STRONG is used after
that, with respect to the STRONG-STRING. Finally the END-STRING is aligned
on the previous STRONG-STRING (the 'heredity principle'). If you want to
change this alignement, use `sli-shift-alist' below.
Note that all INDENT can be either intergers or a cons pair whose first
element is the symbol 'absolute and the second one is an integer:
it means that the indentation is not relative but absolute with
respect to the left margin. It applies also to the next strong/end key.
In this construct, you can also use
[SPECIAL-HEAD-STRING special-head INDENT-SPECIAL-HEAD SEPARATOR]
This key is closed by SEPARATOR which belongs to `sli-separators'
and no other construct in between (except comments); for instance the
'proc/(option)/begin/end_proc' construct of MuPAD is a head/special-head/strong/end.
You can use several [END-STRING end]. The first one is going
to be used by the maid. Furthermore you can use the same END-STR for
several constructs. It then applies to the first 'head' that appears
(going backward).

([BEACON-STRING beacon INDENT-BEACON])
specifies a special string that can be found between a 'head' or a 'strong'
and its corresponding 'soft'. The typical example being 'for t from 1 to 2 do'
and has pattern 'head/beacon/beacon/soft'. If a newline is asked after the
'from' but before the 'to', indentation is done with respect to the beginning
of 'from' and INDENT-BEACON is added except if this newline is asked just after
the beacon key, in which case indentation is done like from before the beacon
but 'math-relation's are ignored. Simply because 'math-relation' are supposedly
closed by the appearance of a beacon, whether a separator has occured or not.

([RELATION-STRING math-relation INDENT-RELATION])
specifies a mathematical type of relation (like '='). Such operators acts either
as beacons  (example 'while t=3D55 do' with pattern 'strong/math-relation/soft')
or else are closed by someone in `sli-separators'. They may contain further
structures in between like in 'foo = if ok then gonethrough=t ; 3 else 5 end_if'.
INDENT-RELATION is used before the appearance of the proper separator.

HEAD-STRING's, MATH-RELATION-STRING's, BEACON-STRING's,
SEPARATOR's should all be different.
SOFT-KEY's and STRONG-KEY's are different from any of the above, but a same soft
or strong key can be used in different constructs. Usual examples are 'then' and 'do'
and the 'elif' in 'if/elif/end_if' and '%if/elif/end_if'.
But because of the way things are, the corresponding INDENT should be
the same throughout. Note that longest match is always taken, so that
if 'while(' is a head (like in gp) and '(' is also a head (almost everywhere),
indentation after 'while(' is the one it should. Same applies for the
two constructs '%if' and 'if' in mupad.

Cdr's are to be evaled.

Technical note: the first element of this list *has to* contain a 'head'. ")
