\section{The large sieve inequality}


The best version of the large sieve inequality from
\cite{Montgomery-Vaughan*74}
and
\cite{Montgomery-Vaughan*73}
(obtained at the same time by A. Selberg) is as follows.
\par 
\begin{thm}{Theorem (1974)}

Let $M$ and $N\ge 1$ be two real numbers. Let $X$ be a set of points of
$[0,1)$ such that 
$$
\min_{x,y\in X}\min_{k\in\mathbb{Z}}|x-y+k|\ge \delta>0.
$$
Then, for any sequence of complex numbers $(a_n)_{M < n\le M+N}$, we have
$$
\sum_{x\in X}\left|
\sum_{M < n\le M+N} a_n \exp(2i\pi nx)
\right|^2
\le \sum_{M < n\le M+N}|a_n|^2 (N-1+\delta^{-1}).
$$
\end{thm}


It is very often used with part of the Farey dissection.
\par 
\begin{thm}{Theorem (1974)}

Let $M$ and $N\ge 1$ be two real numbers. Let $Q\ge1$ be a real parameter.
For any sequence of complex numbers $(a_n)_{M < n\le M+N}$, we have
$$
\sum_{q\in Q}\sum_{\substack{a\mod q,\\ (a,q)=1}}\left|
\sum_{M < n\le M+N} a_n \exp(2i\pi na/q)
\right|^2
\le \sum_{M < n\le M+N}|a_n|^2 (N-1+Q^2).
$$
\end{thm}

The summation over $a$ runs over all invertible classes $a$ modulo $q$.
